The following directory contains all the bars that I have configured. I'm mainly using the ~simpleBar~ right now.

* Current configurations
** simpleBar
Minimal bar with monochrome colors.
** fancyBar
Bar with padding and colors and icons, structuraly familiar to simpleBar.
** modelineBar
Not yet configured Emacs modeline clone.
** vimBar
Just like modelineBar but stylized as a vim statusline.
